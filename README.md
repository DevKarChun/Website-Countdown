# Website Launch Countdown Project

The objective of this small project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Bootstrap and Font Awesome, as well as the utilisation of third-party libraries like [Countdown Rendro JS](https://github.com/rendro/countdown). The project aims to create a simple countdown timer that will be displayed before the launch of a website. By incorporating these libraries, we can enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the countdown, providing users with an engaging experience while they wait for the website to go live.
